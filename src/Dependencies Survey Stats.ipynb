However, there is a notable minority that have relaxed their standards, adopting more of a SemVer based minor range approach, so there is not one single clear direction in changes of practice. There are also some differences between commercial builds and open source builds (With open source builds being more relaxed). There are a number of complaints about the number of transitive dependencies within the NPM community, leading to extremely bloated builds.
